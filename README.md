The **'smart-bicycle-lock'** is a University project that combines NFC technology, an Android web app, and a custom-designed models created in Tinkercad. This GitHub project aims to provide a secure and convenient solution for bicycle owners who want to protect their bikes from theft while embracing the power of modern technology.

## Features
- **NFC Technology**: The lock utilizes Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to enable seamless unlocking and locking of the bicycle. By simply tapping an NFC-enabled device, such as an Android smartphone or a dedicated NFC card, against the lock, users can easily control the lock's status.
- **Android Web App**: The project includes a simple Android web app that acts as the control center for the Smart Bicycle Lock. The app provides an intuitive interface where users can manage the lock's status.
- **Design**: To house the electronics and ensure durability, the *smart-bicycle-lock* features a sleek case created in Tinkercad, a browser-based 3D design and modeling tool. The case is optimized for easy assembly, protection against the elements, and seamless integration with the lock mechanism.
